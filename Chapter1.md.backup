# Chapter 1

Conway Runnels sprinted down the alleyway behind the bazaar. His foot falls made rhythmic slapping as he kept a consistent pace. He'd chance glances backwards, every so often, ensuring he wasn't being followed. The dank alleys were perfect for all manner of illegal shit, 

But, he knew already he was made by that undercover cop.

In front of him, a wall loomed. The dead end of the alley would have been a mistake for him.

Had he been a human. A magicless human.

He started to focus his Will into his outstretched hand, and as he approached the wall, he began to imagine a flexing, rippling texture. The wall began to mirror that texture right as he pushed his way through.

In the portal, Conway's pace changed. He appeared, and felt, like he was moving at a normal rate, but he was moving much, much faster. He tried to keep his eyes locked forward--portal travel can be very disorienting. The entirely white plane was interspliced with dancing shadows--also white--of events, people, and ideas that he was moving around and through. Conway closed his eyes as he exited the portal.

He emerged from the travel point on the busy Canal Boulevard. It was late in the Spring in New Orleans, well past the end of carnival season when no one really had any good reason to be in the city, leaving mostly locals.

Apathetic locals who didn't care about Conway or anyone acting too weird. *Probably a drunk or tweaker*, they would assure themselves, and continue onward. Conway looked around for the bus that ran along the street via a thin wire. The magic powering it was thrumming loudly to Conway. He subconsciously tapped the book in his jacket to keep himself aware that he needed to be careful.

But, also to remind himself he still had the book. The book was causing him so much trouble since he grabbed it. He knew he was stupid to pay for something like it, something that was clearly illegal, but his greed got the better of him. If he sold it at even half of what it was worth, and get it out of the bullshit Paragon's jurisdiction, he'd be set and not have to sell this shit anymore. He could see Emily again. He could be the father she needed.

But, there were a lot of ifs for him to consider. After his customer, the strongest interest he honestly had, turned out to be a cop, Conway began to regret the choices that got him here.

He just needed some more time. Once he could secure someone, he'd be a lot better off.

In the distance, maybe seven to ten blocks away, the trolley was lulling into a stop. It wouldn't be long now, and then, Conway would be free. He would have to work to make another sale; the book was too hot to keep with him, but that was okay. He'd have to vet his potential clients a bit more careful next time, figure out a system to get them to prove they aren't a cop.

But, that was next time. For now, he knew all he had to do was get on that trolley and get as far away from the French Quarter as he could. The trolley would take him clear across town, and then, he could grab a cab and lose any tails. He was safe. He was free.
  
He just had to wait a little bit longer.
