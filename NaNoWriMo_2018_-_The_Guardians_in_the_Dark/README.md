# nanowrimo2018

The repository is a work-in-progress of my attempts to complete NaNoWriMo 2018. CC-BY-4.0

## Contributions

As a modern writer, I want to use technology to provide access to my stories. As such, all my writing is "open source," and released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. This means, in plainest terms, do whatever you want with my work, so long as I am credited.

If you feel so inclined, please submit either comments or edits as desired.

## Structure

Each story in this repository will have a character folder, a worldbuilding folder, and chapters / scenes. This structure is how I write, but I decided to include that in my release to provide a more dynamic approach to writing.

## Releases

When the story is completed, I'll bundle everything up into a single book in a few formats. As part of NaNoWriMo 2018, I will bundle all the writing that was completed at the end of the week.
