# Summary
*Paradarama* is a world reconstructed after a power--the Magus--reveals itself when the world was on the cusp of World War. Decades later, magically-touched people as well as magic wielders are as common as cars and cell phones.

Declan Parish is a normal, human detective in the swamps of Louisiana. When his neice disappears, he begins digging into her life, despite objections from his brother-in-law. In his pursuit of the missing girl, Declan discovers a hidden world he never could have fathomed.

As Parish races to find his neice, he must face personal truths from which he had fled long ago.
