1. ~~Declan Parish arrests a Magus for selling literature about necromancy and crossing the veil.~~
1. He encounters Magus, Sagus, and Sapiens in the precinct as he books the Magus.
1. He's well liked, but he's aware that others who aren't Sapien don't trust him at all.
1. On the way home, he's called by his sister, frantic that her daughter has been gone for a while.
1. He calls his brother-in-law, Robert, to find out what he can.
1. Robert meets him for coffee, and Alan starts to plan how to figure this out, though Robert asks him not to.

### Act 2 - The Investigation

1. Declan has three leads into Allison's disappearance - a Homo Magus Professor at the university, a contact from a social media group, and a diary.
1. The diary discusses Allison learning she's Homo Sagus--a magic-touched person
1. This leads him to speak to Dr. Elrich Crane--a preeminent Magus who's renown for his study of the foundations of the race.
1. While he had controversial opinions of supremacy in his youth, school soften his stances.
1. Dr. Crane breaks down the science behind magic to Parish.
1. Dr. Crane suggests that after conversations with Allison, she went to her hometown for the source of her magic.
1. Parish meets with Gus, a posted on the Magus forum.
1. The conversation is mostly around how Allison believed she was different, and she may be a fourth type of magus - one that is magically touched and in-tune with their abilities without the negatives.
1. Gus mentions she talked about seeing her grandparents, which was in her hometown.
1. Parish, despite Robert's objects, goes to Clearwater, Louisiana to find more leads on Allison.

### Act 3 - The Discovery

1. In Clearwater, Parish meets Ms. Cosley, a librarian
2. In the library, he learns that Clearwater was founded by pure Maguses, and humans and half-breeds were forced out. Families that produced pure maguses were allowed to stay--like Parish's brother-in-law.
3.  The town, as he meets new people, are filled with people who are riddled with the side effects of the magi; lower immune systems, diminished impulse control, and other aliments.
4.  When interviewing people, he meets Heather, a girl from the message boards that Gus mentioned
5.  Heather slips that Allison was in the town; when pressed, she describes a man that Allison was with. Parish recognizes the description and shows her a picture of Robert. She confirms it was him but different.
6.  Parish visits what is supposed to be Robert's family home, but it's a burnt husk. He discovers a collapsed library in a secret room in the basement. There, he discovers journals, including one about necromancy and how to pierce the veil, like from Chapter 1.
7.  Parish realizes why Allison was taken--a Sagus, produced of a two Magus-latent parents--could be used as a vessel to cross over to the realm of the dead
8.  Parish is attacked by masked men and women.
9.  Parish wakes up in an underground mausoleum--he saw articles about this at the library
10.  A man in a really ornate mask speaks to him, sounding like Robert. Parish calls him out.
11.  The man removes the mask, revealing Robert's face, but introduces himself as Nick, Robert's twin.
12.  Nick explains the magic process with Twins is even more erratic than non-twin births. He possesses a lot of power, but he is noticably older than Robert. 
13.  Declan escapes his bonds, and fights with Nick, though Nick has the upperhand, flexing his magic. He kills a few cultists by accident.
14.  In the chaos, Declan releases Allison, who escapes.
15.  Using Nick's rage and instability, Declan tricks him into destroying a supporting wall, which collapses the mausoleum on top of Nick, leaving him presumably dead.
16.  Parish and Allison escape the town and reunite with Robert.

### Act 4 - The Turn

1. Weeks later, Robert and Sheryl, Declan's sister meet him for coffee. Sheryl reveals that like Robert, he had a twin, but the twin died in the womb.
2. Declan was aware he was likely a Sagus, but now, he is unsure if he has magical ability or not.
3. In the end, he determines it doesn't matter; he achieved everything through his own intuition, logic, and determination.
4. Allison meets them and is on the mend and starting to fit in with her accepted place in life.
