# Overview

In World War I, a group of individuals, called the original ten, on both sides of the war used magic for the first time. The result was an instant cessation to conflict.

Instantly, scientist, clerics, and politicians began investigating the experience. They all came to the same conclusion: Magic was real.

In the decades since, magic studies have learned more about what it really is--a deeper connection to the fabric of creation, moving, bending, destroying and creating from it. 

Through science, non mages can do the same.

Through religion, practices have arose about the craft.

Through politics, all of humanity are united with providing the best life for each other. Anti-magic and Anti-Human movements ebb and flow.

The result is a world that is remarkably similar to our own with a bit more ease.
