# Overview
Pandarama is the name of our world after the discovery of Magic, called Magus Mallicarum (google words later).

After magic entered the world, politics changed, economies changed, and science changed. Countries began to deal with the magic-laden in their own ways. Many committed atrocities while some were seized by the magic holding before they saw it coming.  The world is very different because magic provides free, clean power, can create objects and items that would have been purchased, and filled in the gaps in science.

Magic doesn't change human nature, either mage or human and blend. Instead it was a shortcut to solutions, or a broken railroad to destruction.
