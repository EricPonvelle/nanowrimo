# Chapter 2

Declan Parish yawned as his partner rolled yet another cigarette.

It was number six. Paul Reeves was adding each one to a metal case after filling them just past the point where you'd consider them overstuffed. The tobacco smelled like it was from Cuba.

But, it wasn't like Declan was paying attention to that. He stared emptily through the binoculars, doing his best to not think of how delightful and calming a single pull of one of those cancer sticks would be.

"I'm not sharing, Declan," Paul's voice made him jump. "You quit 'For the last time, I swear,' Remember?"

"You could have done that later or something. Not throw it right in my face."

"We've been sitting here for almost four hours. Your guy said our mark bolted and teleported. He could be anywhere." Paul stopped abruptly. "How the fu---" His eyes were trained on a crowd of people that looked a little shocked, but kept moving. In the crowd, he saw Conway Runnels. He could feel Paul's magus senses pulling into full awareness. It was palpable in the car. It made him feel a bit uncomfortable, but magic use always did.

"So, you can just feel when there's another user? Just like that?" Paul was putting the car into drive. Conway was eying a trolley only a few blocks down. The trolleys, modeled after the ones from centuries ago, was installed only a few years ago, and it quickly paid for itself. Using no power except for the abilities of a few magic users throughout the day, the car was cheap, quick, and effective. Tourists loved it because it allowed them to safely and quickly see the entire city's more favorable areas. Locals used it because it was clean and safe.

"Yeah, something like that." Paul was guarded. They were partners for a little while now, but the Magus never liked to overshare with the Sapiens. "I can direct my focus on any magic user, and I can just feel them tapping into that power. I marked and learned Conway's *feeling*, so now, I can spot him out like a brick in a haystack. Just takes a little focus." Conway got on the trolley, looking everywhere. Declan rolled his eyes at how suspicious he looked. *Fucking amateur.* He pulled the car into gear and followed the car with traffic.

"So, why am I even here." Declan tried to hold back the tone of feeling unneeded. Sapiens were prone to coming off as needing kid gloves from the magically inclined. "Not that I'm a supremacist or anything. Anything from it."

"Right." Paul was smirking. He was around 32, putting him only two years younger than Decland, but he looked in his twenties. He was well over Declan's six-two, but he was rail thin. He had to lilac-tinted eyes of the Magi, while Declan was stuck with brown, like his own hair color. Declan kept the regulation short cut, but Paul's was a long mane of gold. Despite his obvious attractiveness, Declan felt no jealousy, and he hated the bias towards his kind.

"I mean it, my sister's husband's one. Well, a Sagus." He cringed at the double faux pas, implying that having a relation to a magic user was somehow negating of his bias, and even then, the Magi didn't trust Sages. He sighed and closed his eyes. "What I mean is, if you got the skills, you can probably do this better, right?

"So, that's all we are? Pack animals to you people?"

Declan gapped, trying to say something, and he realized he was increasingly out of him depth. He stayed quiet until Paul started laughing. "I'm just fucking with you." He began laughing uncontrollable hard and Declan allowed a few chuckles at the red light. The trolley was stopped at a station. Conway didn't get off. He shook his head.

"Asshole."

"Guilty. Nah, I can only smell them out, but you parked right where he came out of the portal. I can't even do that."

"Well, I studied the leylines of the area, knowing he was more used to travel magic, and I followed him for a few weeks after hours." Paul cocked an eyebrow. "I got the time." Paul shook his head.

"I know your background. You are a hero in this town. That should have you swimming in women." Paul's eyes widened. "Or men! I didn't mean to suggest that I'd care about--"

"It's good. No, I just am focused on some other things right now."

"Missing your prime, man. Missing your prime." Paul sat bolt upright. "He's moving. I think he's getting a bead on me, but maybe not."

"This is his stop. He likes One-Eyed Jacks when he needs to burn off the edges. Get ready." Declan parked the car in a parallel spot not far from the next stop of the trolley. Declan entered the bar first, while Paul would trail behind and follow the car in case Conway changed plans. Declan knew better. The man was nothing without his routine.

In the bar, smoky already, Declan signaled for a drink, his usual--whiskey and ginger with a squeeze of lemon. Gale, the most regular bartender here, nodded and made it before he even got to a table. He picked it up, dropped some ones, and she smiled at his usual tip. It was likely more than people paid, but he considered her an investment.

While investigating Conway, he had learned the bones of the bar. He'd seen shows here, come on their most riotous nights, and other times, like right now, when it was deader than the cemetaries. As least those actually had ghosts. It let Declan blow off steam, even if he tried to keep it purely from a "this is work," viewpoint.

He texted Ash of where to meet him. His CI was not unlike Conway, convicted of selling things the Paragon considered "too dangerous for the safety and equilibrium of society," and he was ready to repent for his crimes. This bust would be big for Ash. For Declan too.

The door opened, and Declan covered his smirk with his drink. Conway looked like a wreck. He was sweating profusely, and his eyes were shifty.

"Gale, I need a Long Island, and two shots of Jamison. Shots first." He slid her too much money. "Quickly, please." He scanned the bar. Declan did his best to look like he was drunk texting. A billiard ball clacked in the bar, and laughter erupted from that direction. There were maybe five people in the bar at the moment, not counting the bartender, Declan, and Conway. He got a reply from Ash, and told him to come in now. Conway finished his two shots, and true to form, Gale was already rolling out the massive drink. Declan had wondered if she were Magus.

Ashton opened the door. Paul, flanked him and quickly moved towards the pool table. Conway, unaware, sat between the three of them. His hand was in his coat, but Declan was sure it was just checking on his book. Ash looked his way, Declan nodded. He looked to Paul, who did the same.

"Hey, Connie, I thought we had a deal. Why'd you run?" Ash said. He was covered in tattooes with damp, stringy black hair as long as Paul's. Conway's eyes just closed. He sighed, placed both hands on the bar, and grabbed his drink. He held one finger up, implying that Ash should wait, though it was a finger used to convey other wordless gestures too. He downed the Long Island in a single chug. He cringed as the cold hit him all at once.

"I didn't want trouble, man. I just needed money." Declan could feel the magic building in Conway, as he pulled his service revolver and leveled it on him.

"That's enough of that," said Declan. He could feel Paul pulling magic as well. "You're surrounded. Let's not do this."

Conway turned to Paul and eyed him contemptuously.

"You fucking traitor. I should--" His thoughts were cut off as Gale, completely, perfectly silent, placed a taser to his neck and dropped him. The jolt was just enough to break the magic he was building.

As Conway laid twitching on the floor, Declan walked over and slid another ten to Gale.

"Consider it tip only. Your drinks are very good." He smiled as Paul cuffed Conway. From his jacked, Paul pulled out the *Grand Grimiore* and immediately dropped it.

"Oh, this is some bad shit, Declan." His tone chilled Declan's blood.
