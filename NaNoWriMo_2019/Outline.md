cultivate love with a woman to whom he isn't already in love with.

plot an escape.

  f. He learns in all scenarios, he would snap as he learned more about what the
experiment entails.
  g. He learns that the Greys don't experience time nor age the same way, so
they fly everywhere, without bending the 4th dimension. This means Ja-q has
traveled in real time, several lightyears away in Stasis.

  i. He leaves, vowing to find a way to return home.
