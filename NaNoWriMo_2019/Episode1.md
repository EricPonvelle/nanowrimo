Ja-quine Rinker woke up with vomit spewing from his mouth like a waterfall
breakin free of a senseless, cliffside dam. He began screaming as the sharp
white walls of his confusing cell ripped at the back of his eyes. He tried to
blink away the pain and confusion, but everything felt wrong.

Namely the tube running down his throat and two tinier ones pushing into his
nose. He wanted to remove them, so that he could walk, but the cords rose into
the ceiling. He looked up and moved, and the white of the ceilin moved as a
livin presence to allow the wires to follow him.

Ja-q tried to recall where he was last, and his memories were moving in a sphere
rather than a line.
